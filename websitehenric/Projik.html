    Hi I am Henric ! & Welcome to my webpage I am currently studying the Bachelor of Computer Science in Gordon College
    Olongapo City, I believe in the saying that "You have the power to make all of your Dreams come true & you also have
    the power to mess it all up" because I believe that in life you need to always have a strong mindset especially when
    things do not go your way, you must be always ready to take the Defeats in order for you to succeed the same goes
    with programming in order for a program to run you'll fail multiple times at first & that's the beauty of
    programming because Success achieved with no Failures isn't Success at all.
